There should be no strings attached to your opinions, no one asking you to tone it down, and nobody that really wishes you to just shut the hell up and report just the fluffy pieces. You should also lack the warm and fuzzy attitude of your naysayers (and the trolls) who are always right when they spout off at the mouth in the comment section or on social media.

So here’s an opportunity to show the world how it’s done. A-Minute (or JAM) is an all-round-fun event that is all about the control of the mind over the mouth. Can you make it through sixty seconds of non-stop talking without hesitation, repetition, or deviation? Or will the sheer pressure make you crumble and have your competitors pounce on you in an instant? It is a fun filled literary event where the participants have to speak on the given topic for a maximum of 1 minute. While speaking, they cannot make certain errors. If any one of the fellow participant spots an error while participant is speaking, he/she can clap and point out the error for which they will be rewarded points. Points are also awarded for the time span for which a participant speaks. So fill that unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of impeccable English and you would be the winner",
